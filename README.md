# CV_traffic_system
This is a project of a final year student that i helped in implementing. it use computer vision to control the flow of traffic where the normal timer traffic system still works. This system can be integrated into existing traffic system in cities.
## Brief working Principle
As the traditional traffic system uses timing principle to operate the system enhances it with computer vision to detect flow of traffic. The challenges with the traditional system is that while the traffic light is giving pass to the traffic on certain lane it is untill the timer counts down before pass can be given to other lanes when if there is no traffic on the lane again it is untill the it counts down, and this make driver and other road user feel the system is not intelligent (which is true not and sometimes disgusting for traffic law abiding citizens), this makes most commercial driver flaunt the traffic light and make their pass (breaking the law). 
This system, I will say it an intelligent system the can detect the traffic on a perticular lane and override the timer to give road access to the lane with more traffic but still giving the power back to the timer to countdown again. with this there is equity on the road.....lol.
